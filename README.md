# learning-web-dev
This repository includes snippets of code to show my progress in learning web development. 

I will be keeping track of what I learn as I advance my web development skills. These code snippets are created for www.eyehopecanada.com are a way for me to practice and develop my skills so that later I can create a complete website.

## Custom Loading Page
I learned:
- How to create an overlay
- How to use CSS, JS, and HTML together
- How to create animated graphics

## Contact Form (Front End and Back End)
I learned:
- How to use HTML to create a form

Next Steps:
- Understand basic concepts (how the web works, server-side website programming, sending form data)
- Connnect HTML to back end server (using only code - no plugins/3rd party services like GetForm)
