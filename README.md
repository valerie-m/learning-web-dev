# learning-web-dev
This repository includes snippets of code to show my progress in learning web development. 

I will be keeping track of what I learn as I advance my web development skills. These code snippets are created for eyehopecanada.com are a way for me to practice and develop my skills so that later I can create a complete website.

##Custom Loading Page
I learned:
- How to create an overlay
- How to use CSS, JS, and HTML together
- How to create animated graphics

##Contact Form (Front End and Back End)
I learned:
- How to use HTML to create a form

Next Steps:
- Deploy my own website
- Connnect HTML to back end server (using only code - no plugins/3rd party services like GetForm)
